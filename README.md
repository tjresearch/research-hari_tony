# SelfDrivingCar
This is the code repo for Hari Shanmugaraja and Tony Liang's Senior Research Project

## Overview
Our project aims to create a self-driving remote control car. The car we are using is a Traxxas Rustler, and it will be controlled using a neural network that runs on a Raspberry Pi. We will use LIDAR, cameras, and accelerometers in order to train a recurrent neural network, as they are known for their time series functionality. This project aims to help further and refine research into the autonomous vehicle field by creating a self driving remote-control car that is able to detect and avoid obstacles, all while completing a closed course.

## Dependencies
-Raspbian: Raspberry Pi OS to develop code, and compile Lidar SDK

-RPLIDAR SDK: Lidar code that runs on the Pi

-Matplotlib: Python library to visualize Lidar data
## Installation instructions
-[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

-[RPLIDAR SDK](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Support#rplidar-a-series)

-Matplotlib:    $python -m pip install -U matplotlib

## Run instructions
Instructions to compile and run lidar code can be found [here](http://bucket.download.slamtec.com/351a5409ddfba077ad11ec5071e97ba5bf2c5d0a/LR002_SLAMTEC_rplidar_sdk_v1.0_en.pdf)
## Sample Output
Neural network and Lidar image will be added when we have them
